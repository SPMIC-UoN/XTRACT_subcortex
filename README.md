# XTRACT_subcortex
Tractography protocols for mapping portico-subcortical WM tracts in the human and macaque. 
A part of FSL's XTRACT package.

Our tractogrpahy protocols were created in standard MNI space for the Human and F99 space for the Macaque. They were also warpped to NMT space for the Macaque.
We have a directory per species which includes a directory per tract and a list of tracts (needed when running XTRACT).
Each tract directory contains ROI NIFTIs correspondng to seed, target, exclusion and stop regions.
We have 9 new tracts (bilateral) and we updated 2 tracts (uncinate fasciculus and anterior comissure).
