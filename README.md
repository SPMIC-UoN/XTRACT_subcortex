# XTRACT_subcortex
Tractography protocols for mapping cortico-subcortical WM tracts in the human and macaque. 
Extending previous XTRACT cross-species tractography protocols.

Tractography protocols were created in standard MNI space for the Human and F99 space for the Macaque. They are also warpped to NMT space for the Macaque.
For each species, a directory per tract and a list of tracts (needed when running XTRACT) is included.
Each tract directory contains ROI NIFTIs corresponding to seed, target, exclusion and stop regions.
Ten bilateral tracts in total (Muratoff Bundle, Striatal Bundle (external capsule) - frontal, temporal, parietal, motor parts, Extreme Capsule - frontal, temporal, parietal parts, amygdalofugal tract, uncinate fasciculus, fornix) and one commissural (anterior commissure).
